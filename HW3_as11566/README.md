# Assignment 1: Demonstrated Central Limit Theorem

1. Generated 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000) for each of 5 different distributions (500 samples in total), all with the same population mean
2. Included a Normal, a Poisson, a Binomial, a Chi-Squared distribution, and a logistic distribution
3. For each sample plotted the sample mean (dependent var.) against the sample size N (independent var.) 
4. Plotted the distributions of all sample means (together for all distributions) as a histogram. 

# Assignment 2:Set up the work for data-driven inference based on CitiBike data

Worked off the skeleton notebook of Professor Bianco

# Assignment 3: Finished z-test lab and turned it in as a notebook
