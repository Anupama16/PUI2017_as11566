## Review for the plot

Clarity: The Title of the figure doesn't tie up well with the visualization. Moreover the correlation or R2 values arent specified either.
I infer that HongKai's objective was to show whether it's a linear or polynomial relationship between the two variables visually. In that case, 
it would have been clear by looking at the plot whether the line or the ploynomial is the best fit. But that cannot be visually inferred from the plot, 
as no relationship seem to be existing between the variables. Few suggestions to improve the clarity of the plot - Add a caption that explains the purpose
of the plot and what it is trying to convey. From the plot of the observations it can be seen that the range of values is small for most of the observations,
which indicates that a log relationship might exist between the variables. Or the outliers are masking the actual relationship. Furthermore, adding the R2 
values of the two fits would have added more value.

Esthetic: The plot looks neat with the choice of colours. The axis titles and plot title have been been specified but caption would have been more 
informative. The outliers seem to affect the fit lines and doesnt portray the true fit. 

# FBB the plot violates color blindness safety rules as red and green are indistinguishable to the most common kind of color blindness


Honesty: HongKai has honestly reproduced the data and plotted the figure. References to the data would have backed it up. It looks like an original plot but the chosen 
variables could have been of more pertinence. 

# FBB here honesty does not really refer to is the data manipulated, but is the visualization trying to suggest something that is not suported by the data. I would argue that extrapolating this fit over the hige x range when most data is near x=0 and there the data obviously does not follow the fit can be considered "dishonest" in this sense

9/10
