### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

H0= The % reduction in fat for people after three months of exercisimg is equal to or less than the average fat reduction of people who didnt exercise(P1)

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

H0= The IQ of children whose mothers smoked(P0) while they were pregnant is equal to or greater than the average IQ of children whose mothers were non smokers when they were pregnant(P1)

**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population

H0= The incidence rate of diabetes for people living within 3 miles(P0) of a food desert is less than or equal to the incidence rates of the US population(P1)
